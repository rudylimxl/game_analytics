# Retail Analytics Data Sharing Example
This example illustrates a retail company building a data-sharing hub using Google Cloud technology, mainly BigQuery Analytics Hub + Looker 

Analytics Hub is a data exchange platform that enables you to share data and insights at scale across organizational boundaries with a robust security. Here, the retail company creates a data 'supermarket', a collaborative data sharing space where users (internal and external) can explore and subscribe/use datasets. Like a supermarket, data consumers are free to leave ratings, reviews, comments, etc. Built using BigQuery Analytics Hub API.

Beyond sharing data, the retail company provides embedded analytics and insight by utilizing GCPâ€™s data modeling capability to provide standardized, universal data layer for all data applications, as well as directly embedding dashboards. Built using Looker API.

# Configuration
**1. backend folder**
This is a backend express server that interacts with BigQuery and Analytics Hub.
First, please create a .env file in root directory of backend folder with two variables:

projectID = *your BigQuery projectID*
parent = *path of your analytics hub exchange. For example, mine is 'projects/624018808789/locations/asia-southeast1/dataExchanges/rudy_analytics_hub_demo_18b1197598c'. You can get extract this path from URL you used in GCP web console to access your analytics hub exchange*

These two variables are required to obtain the right listings to be displayed in data 'supermarket'
Second, please create a json file containing gcp service account key in root directory of backend folder. name it "gcp-service-acc.json"

**2. looker_backend folder**
This is another backend express server that interacts with a Looker instance for embedded analytics.
Please create a .env file in root directory of looker-backend folder with two variables:
HOST = *your Looker instance address, without the https://*
LOOKER_EMBED_SECRET = *embed secret obtained from Admin page. Details here:https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-platform-embed#embed_secret*

**3. frontend folder**
This is the front-end React application.
For looker embedding, config can be done in src>components>Company>DashboardLooker.js file.
For example, which target dashboard to be embedded.
